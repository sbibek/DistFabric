# NOTES
1. When testing, there was 4 nodes that are in the conf.json
2. The master and all the nodes have the same shared directory (mandatory)
3. The folder "backups/corpus/project" was inside the "/home/bibek/shared/df/" ie ${sync_dir}/project
4. the search was invoked with the wordlist file available at backups/wordlist/test.txt (it was made available at /home/bibek/test.txt)
   invoke search project /home/bibek/test.txt

Regarding the backup images
There are two images
1. df_master (this has both the node code at ~/df_paralleltasks and master code at ~/df/project (same git project). This has the rabbitmq. The IP for rabbitmq in conf.json should point to this)
2. df_node (this has the node code at ~/df_paralleltasks and connects to rabbitmq in the master)
